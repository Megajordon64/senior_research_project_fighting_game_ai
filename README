Project: developing an AI for fighting games

Goal: to develop an AI intended for use in fighting games that can be trained against other
AIs and have its skill correlate to how well it was trained (effectively how good the AI opponent it
trained against was). This will be accomplished with the use of a version of the Monte Carlo Tree Search engine
and a Neural Network

Author: Jordon Zeigler
Advisor for project: Professor Girard

Note: A program known as fightingICE will be used in this project to help facilitate training the AI
in a fighting game environment. Due to its size the program itself will not be available on the repository but 
instead I will provide a link website for the program as well as links for other resources as they are used
